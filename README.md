I have a Parking App idea. I have this idea for licenta(I really don't know what this really is in english) and I was thinking if I could implement it with less features let's say, here. If I can, then here are the main features or how I think it will work:
You have a parking app and from there you can search for the closest parking spot near you, either free or paid parking spot. 
Then you choose it and mark it as reserved and you will be directed there. 
I thought of it for a normal parking lot so if someone comes and parks there you will get an alert and be redirected to another one. 
The teacher I chose for licenta told me that I could merge this with the hardware part and imagine I have barriers on the parking spot and a camera in front so when you select a parking spot those barriers will only come down when the camera sees your license plate and then a light(that was technically green before because the parking spot was free) will turn either red or off, meaning that the parking spot was occupied ( so the implementation will we for this variant of the app).
Another thing that I thought to do was remembering that spot so when you go back to the car you can be directed there without having to remember where you parked.
This is it so far, I am open to any improvements or suggestions
